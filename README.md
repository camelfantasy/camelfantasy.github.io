# Kruskal Quotes #
To add a quote to the page:

1. Add the audio recording to the `audio` folder. The file can be in any format playable by web browsers.
2. In the `script` section of `kruskal-quotes.html`, add a new object for the quote to the end of the `quotes` array in the same format as the other quotes. The value for the `name` field should be kept short to avoid overflowing onto the next line when displayed.
